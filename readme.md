One of our (midterm) requirements in Workplace Communication is to make an e-portfolio site. I don't like WYSIWYG services as they're kinda ass and I'm used to (n)vim in Termux. Pretend the ~~ghost~~ [""projects""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flood_control_projects_controversy_in_the_Philippines) are already done, ok?
