One of our midterm requirements in Workplace Communication is to make an e-portfolio site. I don't wanna use those website builder services because they kinda suck and I prefer using (n)Vim on Termux. Should've used a WYSIWYG sercice; ts drained 10 years off my life.

Also, let's pretend the frothings in the site are true and I've already done those, not something I _want_ to do.
